# Bus In Carpark Simulator

## Rationale

This was a project for Accordo, but now has sparked an interest in some better build tools.
So the approach is to use node scripts for the basic test/build work.
And one niceness to fall out of this is `zombie`, for headless browser testing.
Another is the node fs.fileWatch feature to do my own linting and testing.

I *could* use the command-line `watch` to run some things periodically, but node is a cross-platform way to achieve the same thing. And I could do with upskilling in node.
