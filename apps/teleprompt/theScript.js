{br:}
#1
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
#2
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
#1
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
#2
I love thee freely, as men strive for right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
#1
I love with a passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
#2
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints, I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life! and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.
