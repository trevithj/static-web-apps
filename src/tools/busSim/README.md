# Bus In Carpark Simulator

## Rationale

This was a project for Accordo, but now has sparked an interest in some better build tools.
So the approach is to use node scripts for the basic test/build work.
And one niceness to fall out of this is Zombie, for headless browser testing.
Another is the node fs fileWatch feature to do my own linting and testing.
