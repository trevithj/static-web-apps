HTML apps that don't require a server.

Many should be able to run even if opened in a browser as a local file. If not, run the `simpleServer.js` script in the root directory using `node .\simpleServer.js` and then navigating to `localhost:8888` in your browser.

There are also a few other node-based scripts for various chores. TODO: move them into their own folder.
